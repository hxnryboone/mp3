1. The code smell here is duplicated code because the same code appears twice in the class.
	We can refactor this by using extract method, where we create a new method from this
	code and call it where it appears originally.
2. The code smell is again duplicated code, so we again extract method.
3. The method calls two methods in the Jenkins class, so the method would be better suited
	to the Jenkins class instead of Nodes. This is the feature envy code smell, and we can
	address it by moving the method from the Nodes class to the Jenkins class.
4. These statements can be put into a for loop that runs four times. We only need to be sure
	to label the outer for loop and change the break statement so that it breaks the labeled
	loop.
